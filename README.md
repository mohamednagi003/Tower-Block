#How to Play
Objective: Stack blocks as high as you can without misaligning them.

The game starts with a moving block near the bottom of the screen.
Each block that is successfully placed moves the next block higher on the screen.
Misaligned blocks will result in a Game Over.
The block's movement speed increases as you stack more blocks, making the game progressively harder.
